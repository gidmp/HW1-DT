# About the homework
Homework 1 is about learning code refactoring. Small changes within the HTML source code were made in order to make it more readable and less complex without affecting any of the behavior and the end result of the code. These changes were miniscule but important bacause code refactoring made the code more readable, thus less prone to error.

Within this project most changes that were made to the semantics of the HTML elements and adding attributes to the images in order to provide accessibility. I also added a reset.css link in order to reduce inconsistencies between browsers and as a mean to increase the quality of life.
